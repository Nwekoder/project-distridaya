# Project Distridaya
### A Simple yet Powerful Inventory Management App

Project Distridaya is an app that are built to manage your inventory. Wether you use it to store your Products data or Materials that will be use to create a product. Powered by `MongoDB` and `express.js`, you can build your Product schema with low-code/no-code and export your currently existing data before changing any schema which is time saving when you are going to migrate to new Schema.

There are 2 folders here:
 - `./server` for Back-End
 - `./app_v1` for Front-End

You can choose what tech-stack to use for your Back-end. The API itself has their own SDK that are works great with `React.js`. But more integration coming soon.

## Getting Started
Open each folder in terminal and run:
```
yarn dev
```
And open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser. The API will listening to port `8086` and the default `app_v1` will fetch to it.

### Some notes
This project project is still in early development! There is a lot of goals that we need to achieve, some of them are:

[ ] Finish the `app_v1` UI.

[ ] Create the actual SDK.

[ ] Create `React` integration.

[ ] Create `Svelte` integration.

[ ] Find a way to simplified development process (Maybe turning this project in Monorepo).

[ ] Updating authentication method.

[ ] Create the actual backup functionality.
